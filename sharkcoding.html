                    <div class="image-caption cyber-text">From ocean depths to code depths - A career transformation</div>
                    <p class="cyber-text">My journey started underwater — literally. Working in the scuba industry and marine conservation meant days of guiding dives, tagging turtles, and giving "Save the Reef" speeches to tourists who mostly just wanted to see a shark and live to tell the tale. It was adventurous, fulfilling, and let's be honest — who wouldn't want the ocean as their office?</p>
                    
                    <p class="cyber-text">However, as much as I loved the sea, the job had its limits. The industry can be physically demanding (dive tanks aren't light), seasonal, and as glamorous as it sounds, eating rice and beans on a beach hut salary wears thin after a while. Plus, corals and whale sharks don't offer health insurance.</p>

                    <p class="cyber-text">At some point, I found myself staring into the horizon thinking, "What now?" I had skills — leadership, project management, and the ability to stay calm under pressure (like when an octopus stole my GoPro). What I didn't have? A clue about what I wanted to do next.</p>

                    <p class="cyber-text">The transition wasn't exactly smooth sailing. Coding languages don't care if you once navigated ocean currents — Python doesn't even swim. I started small — online courses, bootcamps, and countless YouTube tutorials that made me feel both inspired and wildly underqualified.</p>

                    <blockquote class="cyber-quote">
                        "If you can memorize dozens of dive sites, marine species, and safety protocols, you can learn to code. Debugging an app is surprisingly similar to troubleshooting dive gear, except when things break, no one drowns."

                    <p class="cyber-text">Breaking into tech can feel daunting, but the good news is that the tech industry loves career changers. There's something refreshing about people who didn't follow the traditional path — especially if your LinkedIn profile includes "Certified Dive Instructor" next to "Cloud Engineer."</p>

                    <p class="cyber-text">I won't lie — I miss the ocean. But now I get to solve puzzles, build things, and occasionally remind my tech colleagues that sharks aren't actually dangerous (unlike deploying on a Friday).</p>
