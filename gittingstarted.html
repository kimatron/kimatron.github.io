                    Let's talk about Git. And before you run away screaming, hear me out. I'm probably the last person you'd expect to be writing about version control. I once lost my wetsuit in a studio apartment. A studio apartment. How do you even do that? But that's exactly why I fell in love with Git - it's basically a time machine for people who can't keep track of their stuff.
                </p>

                <div class="cyber-box">
                    <p>Quick note: This isn't your typical Git tutorial. If you're looking for a deep dive into Git internals, there are better guides out there. This is for people like me who just want to stop losing their work and maybe look a bit more professional in the process.</p>

                    <h2>What's Git Anyway?</h2>
                    
                    <p>Remember playing video games where you could save your progress and go back to that save point when things went wrong? That's Git, but for your code (or any text files, really). It's like having infinite undo buttons, each with a little note saying "this is where I added that feature that actually worked."</p>

                    <div class="cyber-callout">
                        <p>True story: My first week using Git, I accidentally deleted half my code. Instead of having a panic attack (okay, I still had a small one), I just rolled back to my last commit. Magic.</p>

                    <h2>Getting Started (For Real)</h2>
                    
                    <p>First things first - you need to set up Git. It's like setting up a new phone, but less annoying and you only have to do it once. Here's the bare minimum:</p>

                    <div class="code-block">
                        <pre><code># Tell Git who you are
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your@email.com"

# Start tracking a project
git init

# Check what's going on
git status</code></pre>
                    </div>

                    <p>That's it. You're now officially using Git. Feel free to put it on your LinkedIn.</p>
                </section>

                <section class="article-section">
                    <h2>The Three Commands You'll Actually Use</h2>
                    
                    <p>Let's be real - Git has tons of commands, but you'll probably use these three 90% of the time:</p>

                    <div class="cyber-box">
                        <ul class="cyber-list">
                            <li>git add . (stage your changes - think "I want to keep these changes")</li>
                            <li>git commit -m "did stuff" (save your changes - but please write better messages than that)</li>
                            <li>git push (send your changes to GitHub or wherever)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                </section>

                <section class="article-section">
                    <h2>When Things Go Wrong</h2>

                    <p>And they will. Oh boy, will they ever. Here's what I've learned from breaking things:</p>

                    <div class="cyber-callout">
                        <p>git status is your friend. When in doubt, run git status. It's like checking your air gauge while diving - you can never do it too often.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>If you really mess up, there's always:</p>

                    <div class="code-block">
                        <pre><code># The "oh crap" button
git reset --hard HEAD

# The "let me pretend that never happened" command
git branch backup-just-in-case
git reset --hard HEAD~1</code></pre>
                    </div>
                </section>

                <section class="article-section">
                    <h2>Branches: Your New Best Friend</h2>
                    
                    <p>Branches are like parallel universes for your code. Want to try something crazy? Make a branch. Don't like how it turned out? Delete it and pretend it never happened. It's like having a save point before fighting the final boss.</p>

                    <div class="cyber-box">
                        <p>Pro tip: Never work directly on main. Ever. It's like editing your only copy of a document - technically possible, but why risk it?</p>
                    </div>
                </section>

                <section class="article-section">
                    <h2>The Stuff I Wish Someone Had Told Me</h2>

                    <p>After messing up in every way possible, here's what I've learned:</p>

                    <div class="cyber-callout">
                        <ul>
                            <li>Commit early, commit often. It's like saving your game - you can never do it too much</li>
                            <li>Write commit messages your future self can understand</li>
                            <li>Don't panic when you see merge conflicts - they're annoying, not fatal</li>
                            <li>Back up your stuff to GitHub (learned this one the hard way)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                </section>

                <section class="article-section">
                    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
                    
                    <p>Git isn't perfect. Sometimes it feels like trying to drive a spaceship when all you wanted was a bicycle. But it's saved my bacon more times than I can count, and it might save yours too.</p>

                    <p>And hey, if I can learn Git, anyone can. I mean, remember the wetsuit story? Yeah. You've got this.</p>

                    <div class="cyber-box">
                        <p>P.S. I eventually found the wetsuit. It was in the freezer. Don't ask.</p>
